# Apply GORM and Gin in order to fulfil CURD

## Gorm (mysql: 192.168.1.72:3306)

Gorm is a framework by which developers can
use go to get access to a variety of databases
including mysql. In this GIT, I fulfil the crud
through mysql.

There is a prerequisite that developers should be 
familiar with language of mysql.
